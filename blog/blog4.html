        My Wardrobe, Now a Database: How 198 Items Made Me Feel Lighter
      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          I didn't wake up one day and think, "I'll digitize my entire closet!"
        </p>
        <p>It started with frustration.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I kept feeling like I had *nothing to wear*, even with drawers full of
          clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would shop impulsively—only to realize I already had something
          similar.
        </p>
        <p>Putting together outfits became a guessing game.</p>
        <p>
          I couldn't remember what I owned, where things were, or how much I
          actually had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes I'd stand in front of my wardrobe and think, "Why is it so
          chaotic?"
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>And so I began building a digital closet.</p>
        <p>A place where I could see everything clearly.</p>
        <p>A place where choices became intentional.</p>
        <br />
        <p>How I Actually Built the System (So You Can Too):</p>
        <br />
        <img src="pics/blog4.png" alt="blog4" class="w-full" />
        <br />
        <p>1. Start with a blank Notion table.</p>
        <p>
          Use the database view (not gallery or kanban—you'll need columns!).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>2. Columns I used (and recommend):</p>
        <p>- Item Type (T-shirt, Skirt, Blazer…) – as a tag</p>
        <p>- Season (Spring, Summer…) – helps with rotation</p>
        <p>- Color – for visual balance</p>
        <p>- Material – cotton, linen, wool</p>
        <p>
          - Image – I uploaded photos from my phone (Notion makes this super
          easy!)
        </p>
        <p>- Storage Method – e.g., at home, in a box, with family</p>
        <p>- Value/Price (if you remember it)</p>
        <p>- Keep / Sell / Donate – most important for decision-making!</p>
        <br />
        <p>3. Use filters and groups.</p>
        <p>
          Try filtering by "Season: Summer" + "Keep" to see what you *actually*
          have for the hot days ahead.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>4. Add a "Maybe" tag.</p>
        <p>
          For emotional pieces or ones you can't decide on, check back in 30
          days.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          5. Bonus tip: Create a chart (e.g., "Most Used" vs "Never Worn") if
          you want to go full Marie Kondo meets Google Sheets.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As I filled in the columns—198 items in total—I started seeing things
          clearly, maybe for the first time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It wasn't just about managing clutter. It was about facing myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The duplicates. The rarely-worns. The "I swear I'll wear this someday"
          lies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized how much space these silent, passive decisions had been
          taking in my brain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I created a "Sell" and "Donate" tag.</p>
        <p>Some pieces I gave to my family. Others I listed online.</p>
        <p>Letting them go wasn't painful. It was… freeing.</p>
        <p>They had already served their purpose.</p>
        <br />
        <p>But the magic was in what stayed.</p>
        <p>
          I found my favorite worn-out T-shirts again, the ones that *still*
          make me feel most like myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I even discovered a few hidden gems: a cream-colored skirt I hadn't
          touched since 2020, now re-entering the rotation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There's something beautiful about treating your things with intention.
        </p>
        <p>Not in a "live with less" kind of way—but "live with awareness."</p>
        <br />
        <p>So yes, now my closet lives in Notion.</p>
        <p>It's searchable, sortable, and fully mine.</p>
        <p>And weirdly enough—it feels like a mirror.</p>
