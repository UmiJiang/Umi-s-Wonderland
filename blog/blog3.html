        When Good People Stay Quiet, Bad Narratives Win
      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>Say Something. Even If You're Shaking.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This morning, I was walking to buy breakfast when I heard Jiang
          Fangzhou say something that cracked my internal shell a little:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "In the internet world, it's far too easy to be a bad person. The cost
          is low. But it's incredibly hard to be a good one."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          She was talking about Love in the Time of Cholera, not as a romantic
          epicâ€”but as a long, calculated act of male self-delusion. A man
          rewriting his own story into something noble, when it was anything
          but. And I thoughtâ€”why do we let these narratives stand?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There's something deeply unsettling about how often the speakerâ€”the
          narratorâ€”is already standing on a moral pedestal before we can even
          question them. Once the wrong person gets to speak first, it's hard to
          challenge their framing. Their story becomes the story.
        </p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          It happens all the time online. Especially in China, where public
          opinion spirals through reversals and re-reversals with every trending
          event. One minute someone's a villain. Then a victim. Then a meme. The
          truth gets buried beneath a dozen edits and a hundred hot takes.
        </p>
        <p>And we're left wondering: should I even speak?</p>
        <br />
        <p>The answer, I think, is yes.</p>
        <p>Not because we're certain.</p>
        <p>But because silence gives bad narratives free reign.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I've been avoiding speaking online.</p>
        <p>Not because I have nothing to say, but because I've been afraid.</p>
        <p>Afraid of trolls. Afraid of being misunderstood.</p>
        <p>Afraid that if I speak up, someone will twist my words.</p>
        <p>So I stay silent. I nod quietly. I log off.</p>
        <br />
        <p>But maybe that's the problem.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The fewer good people speak, the louder the bad ones sound.</p>
        <p>Not because they're smarter. Just less afraid.</p>
        <p>Not because they're right. Just more relentless.</p>
        <br />
        <p>So here's my vow, small but real:</p>
        <p>I want to say more.</p>
        <p>Leave more thoughts behind.</p>
        <p>Even if I'm not sure they're perfect.</p>
        <p>Even if someone might attack them.</p>
        <p>Even if I shake while typing.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because silence doesn't protect anyone. It just makes the wrong voices
          feel like the majority.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>ðŸ“š</p>
        <p>
          On my run later, I listened to Jiang againâ€”this time her breakdown of
          One Hundred Years of Solitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          She spoke about how MÃ¡rquez uses repetition to show how human fate
          loops and doubles back on itself.
        </p>
        <p>There's a strange comfort in that.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But the most comforting thing, for me, was Jiang herself. Her voice,
          her care with words, her unapologetic thoughtfulness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I highly recommend her podcast Yi Cun.</p>
        <p>
          Not just for her literary insight, but for the reminder that
          thoughtful voices matterâ€”and deserve to be heard.
