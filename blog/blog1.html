        <p>
          It's wild how a random "hey-let's-go" turned into one of the most
          empowering things I've done lately.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I tried bouldering for the first time today. That's the one where you
          climb short walls‚Äîno ropes, no harness‚Äîjust your hands, your feet,
          your grit‚Ä¶ and a big cushy mat waiting underneath.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Climbing is strangely addictive. I wasn't prepared for how *much* of
          it happens in your mind. My arms and legs followed orders, but the
          real war was in my head:
        </p>
        <p>"That hold's too far."</p>
        <p>"You'll fall."</p>
        <p>"Maybe just stop here‚Äîit's safe."</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          But I saw girls beside me‚Äîstrong, fierce, relentless. They didn't know
          me, but their silent encouragement echoed louder than words. Falling,
          laughing, trying again. That energy is contagious.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Before my second try, a female coach said something that stuck: "The
          first thing you need to learn is how to fall‚Äîonce you know that, you
          won't be afraid anymore." It flipped a switch in my brain. The fear of
          falling is what holds us back, not the actual fall.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Later, I chatted with a girl who climbs like a pro. She told me she
          still has to do a lot of mental prep before a tough climb. "Sometimes
          I fail just because I didn't truly believe I could do it," she said.
          That landed deep. It's not just about strength‚Äîit's about belief.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I made it to the top of my first "V0" route (yes, I now know what a
          "V0" is!). That first success, however small, tasted better than any
          to-do list checkbox. And guess what‚ÄîI already have my "next mission"
          picked out for tomorrow. A slightly tougher one. A bit higher. A bit
          scarier. That's the point.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I think I've found a new sport that feels right for me. There's
          something symbolic here‚Äîbecause isn't life like that too? Even if
          we're not climbing literal walls, we hesitate because we fear failure.
          Especially as women, we're often taught to be cautious. No wonder the
          gym was filled with girls, all pushing themselves beyond their fears.

        <p>Notes from a Bouldering Beginner</p>
        <p>
          - Wear tight shoes. Seriously. The rental ones hurt, but apparently,
          they're supposed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Use your legs more than your arms. I learned this the hard way when
          my arms turned into soggy noodles after 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Rest between climbs. Watching others and studying their moves is
          part of the fun (and the learning).
        </p>
        <p>
          - It's okay to fall. The floor is padded, your ego isn't. Let it go.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          What I loved most wasn't just climbing‚Äîit was *figuring myself out*
          mid-air. That moment of "I can't" turning into "wait‚Ä¶ maybe I can?"
          That's magic.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Can't wait to go back tomorrow.</p>
