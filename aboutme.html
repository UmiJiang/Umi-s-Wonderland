            <p>
              I like diving into the content world. From leading "bunker exploration squads" in my industrial hometown to becoming a "content nomad" in tech, I've always fought for one thing: Raw stories that punch you in the gut, not sugar-coated fairytales.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              After 8 years sharpening my blades on corporate battleships (yes, LinkedIn was my dojo), I've gone rogue with three ironclad rules:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>‚ú® AI as my sword, not my master</p>
            <p>Let bots handle the grunt work, but the final cut? That's my sacred tea ceremony. Think of it like my train-driver dad - he let machines stoke the furnace, but that throttle? His calloused hands only.</p>
            <br>
            <p>‚ú® Only collabs that make my soul hum</p>
            <p>Helped AI startups crack open their tech black boxes. Guided mental health platforms to ditch trauma porn for real talk. If you lead with "Can you guarantee 100k views?", I'll slide you a milk tea and whisper: "Let's first talk about the dent you want to make in this universe."</p>
            <br>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto">
        <p>‚ú® Ethics baked deeper than matcha in mochi</p>
        <p>Walked away from my first startup when my co-founder wanted paid reviews. Now my first filter for any project: "Will this make someone's life genuinely better?"</p>
        <br>
        <p>What's cooking in my lab:</p>
        <br>
        <p>ü§ñ AI Product Management Cert - Staying ahead of the robot uprising, one course at a time</p>
        <p>üéûÔ∏è Travel vlogging - My antidote to digital overload (and excuse to eat street food)</p>
        <p>üßó Bouldering brainwaves - Learned more from rock walls than MBA textbooks: "No safety net? That's when you find wings."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Legit credentials:</p>
        <br>
        <p>üêà Laobai's Human Secretary - My workflow crashes without his paw approval on documents</p>
        <p>üéÆ Souls Game Glutton for Punishment - Will die 87 times to beat a boss, just to taste that sweet, sweet rage-quit victory</p>
