            <p class="mt-2">
              <P>
                It’s wild how a random “hey-let’s-go” turned into one of the most
                empowering things I’ve done lately. 
              </P>
              <br>
              <p>
                I tried bouldering for the
                first time today. That’s the one where you climb short walls—no
                ropes, no harness—just your hands, your feet, your grit… and a big
                cushy mat waiting underneath. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Climbing is strangely addictive. I
                wasn’t prepared for how *much* of it happens in your mind. My arms
                and legs followed orders, but the real war was in my head: "That
                hold’s too far."
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                "You’ll fall."
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                 "Maybe just stop here—it’s safe."

              “I Saw Myself in the Wired”: A First-Timer’s Journey into Serial

                I thought I was watching an
                anime—but what I experienced felt more like a dream, or maybe a
                virus crawling through my subconscious.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                I watched Serial
                Experiments Lain for the first time last night. It was late, and
                the room was quiet—too quiet, in hindsight. The moment it started,
                I felt... off. Not scared, but unsettled. Like something had
                already entered me and was asking, quietly: “Are you really here?”
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                  This is not a review from someone who grew up on this anime or
                  studied its references in a film class. This is from someone who
                  stumbled in barefoot, wide-eyed, and maybe a little too
                  vulnerable. And got overwhelmed.

              <br>
              <p>This morning, I was walking to buy breakfast when I heard Jiang Fangzhou say something that cracked my internal shell a little:</p>
              <br>
              <p>"In the internet world, it's far too easy to be a bad person. The cost is low. But it's incredibly hard to be a good one."</p>
              <br>              
              <p>She was talking about Love in the Time of Cholera, not as a romantic epic—but as a long, calculated act of male self-delusion. A man rewriting his own story into something noble, when it was anything but. And I thought—why do we let these narratives stand?</p>

              <p>I would shop impulsively—only to realize I already had something similar.</p>  
              <p>Putting together outfits became a guessing game.</p>  
              <p>I couldn't remember what I owned, where things were, or how much I actually had.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Fair question. I had just shown him Lexrespira's latest video on Bilibili, where she offered a quiet, slow unpacking of a novel we both knew. Her voice is deliberate, every word placed with care, and her interpretations often glide across unexpected angles—tones, silences, metaphors I had missed completely.</p>
              <br>
              <p>He didn't understand why I'd want to watch someone explain a book I could read.</p>  
              <p>But I knew exactly why.</p>
