          How Brands in China Are Redefining Wellness‚ÄîOne Emotion at a Time
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>What does it mean to be "healthy" in 2025?</p>
        <br />
        <p>Is it about six-pack abs and 10,000 steps a day?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Or is it lighting a lavender candle at 10:43PM and whispering "I'm
          fine, really"?
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="pics/article1-1.png" alt="casestudy1-1" class="w-full" />
        <br />
        <p>Welcome to China's new era of wellness.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It's ritualistic, emotional, and often a little weird‚Äîbut it works. At
          least, it feels like it does.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As China's wellness industry balloons toward a projected ¬•30 trillion
          (~$4.1 trillion USD) market by 2030, one thing is clear:
          <span class="italic"
            >brands aren't just responding to consumer health needs‚Äîthey're
            shaping what health means.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Some do it through scent.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Some through plushies.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Some by helping you fall asleep.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And some? They just want you to trust them while they rebuild your
          mitochondria.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In this piece, I'll walk through 4 branding trends in China's wellness
          space‚Äîand how each brand defines health on their own terms, embedding
          their products as tools, rituals, and sometimes, emotional sidekicks.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="text-2xl">1. üß∏ Jellycat: The Toy That Hugs You Back</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You could call it a plush toy. But for many Chinese millennials,
          Jellycat is something else entirely:
          <span class="italic">a licensed emotional support object.</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Imported from the UK, Jellycat exploded in popularity not just for its
          cuteness‚Äîbut for its <span class="italic">sadness.</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="pics/article1-2.jpg" alt="casestudy1-2" class="w-full" />
        <br />
        <p>(cute toy snakes for the year of snake)</p>
        <br />
        <p>Many of their toys come with tiny tags that say things like:</p>
        <br />
        <p>"Please look after me."</p>
        <br />
        <p>It's simple, earnest, and kind of devastating.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In a fast-moving world where burnout is baseline, Jellycat offers
          something rare: <span class="italic">permission to be soft.</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">So how does this become a wellness product?</p>
        <br />
        <p>‚Ä¢ Jellycats aren't sold only in toy stores.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They're found in curated lifestyle boutiques, bookstores, even therapy
          centers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ Social media users stage "daily check-ins" with their plushies:
          holding them while journaling, taking photos of them on vacation, or
          posting captions like "my therapist is busy so he sent his assistant."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ They've become visual metaphors for how we wish we were treated:
          gently, consistently, and without performance pressure.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">Brand insight:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Jellycat doesn't <span class="italic">say</span> they're selling
          wellness. But in this emotional economy, a plush toy becomes a
          stand-in for self-kindness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>And that, arguably, is the first step toward healing.</p>
        <br />

        <p class="text-2xl">
          2. üå´Ô∏è to summer ËßÇÂ§è: When Healing Becomes a Cultural Ritual
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If most wellness brands today offer peace through products, to summer
          (ËßÇÂ§è) offers it through scent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Born in Beijing and rooted in contemporary reinterpretations of
          Eastern aesthetics, to summer isn't just a fragrance brand‚Äîit's a
          slow-living movement disguised as scent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While Western aroma brands often promise "calm" or "clarity," to
          summer leans into a different kind of wellness: symbolic, spatial, and
          poetic.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Their core message? "To live beautifully is to feel deeply."</p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">So how do they define wellness?</p>
        <br />
        <p>‚Ä¢ As spiritual texture.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Their incense, solid perfumes, and botanical scents aren't just
          olfactory‚Äîthey're experiential. Each blend is inspired by Chinese
          gardens, literary motifs, or seasonal festivals. Scent becomes story.
          Fragrance becomes ritual.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>‚Ä¢ As curated space.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          to summer doesn't chase algorithmic virality. They don't do e-commerce
          platforms. Instead, they build offline sanctuaries‚Äîcarefully curated
          stores designed like art exhibitions, where you're invited to pause,
          not purchase.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Even their events‚Äîlike roundtables with artists, performance projects,
          and literary salons‚Äîfeel more like cultural programming than product
          launches.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>‚Ä¢ As writing.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Here's the twist: the brand's most powerful product might be‚Ä¶ its
          words.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Their social media posts, campaigns, and scent descriptions read like
          mini essays‚Äîsubtle, introspective, and evocative.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>A candle might not just be "warm."</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It might be "the comfort of old linen warmed by the sun in your
          grandmother's garden."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That's not copy. That's a mood. And people resonate with it‚Äîdeeply.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">Brand Insight:</p>
        <br />
        <p>In an era of quick-fix wellness, to summer offers slow resonance.</p>
        <br />
        <p>It's not about solving problems. It's about inviting presence.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Their users don't just buy a product. They enter a world‚Äîone scented
          with memory, ritual, and beauty.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl">Brand insight:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Healing doesn't have to be dramatic. Sometimes, it's just having a
          corner of the world that smells like peace.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="text-2xl">
          üõèÔ∏è 3. JustChill Ë∫∫Â≤õÔºöSleep can be a different experience
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>There's something deeply comforting about a brand telling you:</p>
        <br />
        <p>"You don't need to optimize your life. Just lie down. Literally."</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That's the philosophy behind JustChill Ë∫∫Â≤õ, a rising Chinese sleep
          brand that doesn't preach hustle or productivity. It leans into
          inactivity as healing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But don't confuse it with laziness marketing. JustChill turns sleep
          into a curated experience: visual, emotional, and scent-driven.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">So how does a sleep brand define wellness?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ Their flagship products‚Äîpillow sprays, relaxing bath cubes,
          pre-sleep audio‚Äîaren't positioned as "fixers," but as "mood-setters."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>‚Ä¢ Their copywriting is disarmingly honest. Example:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "This spray won't erase your anxiety. But it might buy you 17 minutes
          of peace. And that's enough."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ Their limited-edition drops include "Sunday Night Worry Kits,"
          "Sleepover Calm Boxes," and bedtime affirmations written in soft
          pastels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">Brand insight:</p>
        <br />
        <p>Sleep is no longer a biological function. It's a lifestyle scene.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          JustChill doesn't just help you fall asleep‚Äîit helps you feel okay
          about needing rest in the first place.

          üíä 4. UndoAge Ëê•ÂÖªÂ∑•ÂéÇÔºöWhen Trust Becomes the Best Supplement
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When people say "the Xiaomi of health supplements," they're talking
          about UndoAge.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Born from a founder who "just wanted to fix the messed-up supplement
          industry," UndoAge isn't trying to be fancy‚Äîit's trying to be honest,
          efficient, and trustworthy in a space that's long been full of shady
          markups and broken promises.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "This industry is slow, overpriced, and full of BS. Someone needs to
          break it‚Äîand I want to be that guy."
        </p>
        <p>‚Äî Zhu Xiaomu, UndoAge Founder (via Sina Finance)</p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">So how do they define wellness?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ <span class="italic">As clarity.</span> Each product shows not just
          the ingredients, but also where they're from, who else is using the
          same ones, and why the price is what it is. Think: D3, NMN,
          Magnesium‚Äîbut annotated like a Reddit AMA.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ <span class="italic">As accessibility.</span> Prices are shockingly
          low (a bottle of 95% fish oil sells for ¬•59), because they cut out
          platforms like JD or Tmall and instead operate through WeChat
          mini-programs, promoting on podcasts, and private channels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ <span class="italic">As education.</span> Instead of pushing sales,
          UndoAge invests in content partnerships with top Chinese podcasts that
          target stressed-out knowledge workers‚Äîarguably the most "health-aware"
          group in China. Think: Dongdong Xi Xi, Miye Eating Class, Meme Radio.
          Their ads don't just say "buy this," they say "here's why your brain
          fog is fixable."
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>(top podcasts promoting UndoAge)</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ‚Ä¢ <span class="italic">As dialogue.</span> The platform invites users
          to chat directly with certified nutritionists through 1-on-1
          consultations embedded into the shopping experience. Reviews aren't
          just star ratings‚Äîthey're screenshots of sleep scores, daily logs, and
          health tracker data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">Brand Insight:</p>
        <br />
        <p>UndoAge isn't selling hope. It's selling control.</p>
        <p>
          Not the kind you get from rigid routines, but from
          <span class="italic"
            >understanding what you're putting in your body, why it matters, and
            who's behind it.</span
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">So‚Ä¶ What Are Brands Really Selling?</p>
        <br />
        <p>Not only about health.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They're selling definitions of wellness‚Äîstories we want to believe in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>And each brand answers the same question differently:</p>
        <br />
        <p>"What does it mean to feel okay?"</p>
        <br />
        <p>For some, it's hugging a bunny.</p>
        <br />
        <p>For others, it's learning about your B-vitamin ratio.</p>
        <br />
        <p>For most of us? It's something in between.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-xl">Three Questions for Branding:</p>
        <br />
        <p>1. What kind of "health" does the product emotionally represent?</p>
        <br />
        <p>2. Is the audience craving functionality‚Äîor a feeling?</p>
        <br />
        <p>3. Can the product live inside a daily ritual, or create one?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because the future of wellness isn't just about "what works." It is a
          life style. And It's about what
          <span class="italic">makes us feel like we're trying.</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That effort, no matter how small, is sometimes the healthiest thing of
          all.
